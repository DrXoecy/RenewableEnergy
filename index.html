                    Much like a renewable resource, renewable energy comes from a source that has an infinite supply -
                    it
                    will never end. More specifically, renewable energy is less harmful to the environment and does
                    not
                    release as many greenhouse gases. There are many different kinds of renewable energy and these
                    all
                    range in difficulty to harness and the concentration of the power. This means that only certain
                    energy sources are worth thinking about as the results of all the painstaking effort could be
                    rather
                    minute.

                    rewarding
                    than others and some have extremely negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, only certain
                    types of energy can be classed as renewable. Some examples of this are:

                <h2>Hydrothermal energy is the process of collecting energy from a large body of water. This is a
                    complex process that requires a large body of water to be heated. The energy was formed from the
                    creation of the planet and the radioactive decay of the materials that are under the Earthâ€™s
                    surface. There are many advantages to the use of Hydrothermal energy. An example of this is that
                    hydrothermal energy is thought to be up to 10,000 times that amount of energy than other sources
                    that have been used for hundreds of years. Despite this, hydrothermal energy still has some
                    disadvantages. One of these is that cost to collect the energy is rather taxing. However, over
                    time
                    the energy will most definitely be more popular, which will decrease its cost.
